# Assumptions (Well, not really.)

1. "Works" in IE11 (at least functionally).
2. Not tested in Safari (using a Windows machine).
3. Apply filter button doesn't trigger on enter button keypress.
4. Keywords filter is not case-sensitive.
5. No Flux/Redux for API access/state management since it would be overkill.
6. No smooth scrolling for "scroll to main" and "back to top" buttons.
7. Colors/spacing/margins/paddings are not exact (no PhotoShop).
